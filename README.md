# QiskitCypherPOC
Let's say you want to break into a secure server that uses encryption to protect its data. <br>
With Qiskit, you can create a quantum algorithm that can crack the encryption and give you access to the server's data. <br>
This is just a simple example to give you an idea to build on if you have an interest in QC & Cybersecurity showing how easy you can decrypt something using QC.
